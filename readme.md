## Random thoughts (find a better place for these)

Coop tutorial climbing a mountain, fighting enemies. Battle their way down.
Show current resource over the players' heads, can only carry one at a time
Wall jumping
Small default jump, much bigger bonus jump
Players are on a spiritual journey
Retro aesthetics, behind the play field is a "reflection" of a bedroom or a more realistic mountain?
